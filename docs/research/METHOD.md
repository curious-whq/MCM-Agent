# Current Method

## Static hierarchy

1. Prefer physical module/instance hierarchy.
2. If a physical module is too large, recursively create module-internal WorkUnits from immediate event-state structure and state/dependency structure.
3. Event slices are analysis primitives, not final abstraction units.
4. Shared logic/state is promoted to the parent and never copied between children.
5. Coverage is fail-closed: no statement/state/event may silently disappear or be multiply owned.
6. A parent replaces a completed child with a child µMCM summary rather than rereading child RTL during semantic synthesis.

## µMCM generation

Current experimental language uses:

- occurrences: boundary or RTL-grounded derived occurrences;
- persistent predicates;
- transaction/object identity;
- semantic cases;
- candidate axioms;
- environment assumptions and unresolved obligations.

The LLM may propose candidates, but candidate axioms are not trusted by default.

## Validation and trust

Validation levels are intentionally separated:

```text
GROUNDED
  -> PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED / STRUCTURALLY_SUPPORTED
  -> FORMALLY_PROVED
  -> SPEC_PROVED
```

Only `FORMALLY_PROVED` or `SPEC_PROVED` axioms may enter `trusted_umcm.json`.

Completeness is not assumed. Missing axioms are expected to make the µMCM an over-approximation. Later system-level counterexamples are checked against concrete RTL; spurious traces drive counterexample-guided µMCM refinement.

## Bottom-up synthesis

Parent synthesis must preserve provenance. A parent axiom can be:

- inherited from a child;
- lifted/generalized from one or more case-specific child axioms;
- emergent from multiple child contracts plus parent-local RTL/glue.

Any generalization must record `derived_from` information so the user can observe how several lower-level axioms became one higher-level axiom.
